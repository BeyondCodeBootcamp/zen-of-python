# Zen of Python typographic poster

 ## If you're interested in a printed version, you can:

 - Buy one on [DeviantArt](http://ewjoachim.deviantart.com/art/Zen-of-Python-Poster-397139195). I get arond 15% of the price and so far, I've been sending this money (which for 2 years of this poster beeing sold was $10 !) to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/)
 - Have it printed by a professionnal nearby on glossy paper for $20 to $80 depending on the size (of the poster) and the greediness (of your nearby print company). (I got mine for ~$40 but the quality is really neat)
 - Display it on a giant TV or using a projector, but that's not cool for both penguins and your elecricity bill.

## This poster of the Zen of Python uses material borrowed from different source:

 - [The Zen of Python by Tim Peters](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), included in every good distribution of Python if you type ``import this``
 - It mainly uses the [Menlo font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)) which is used by [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) on OSX
 - It uses the [Monokai](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/) color scheme
 - There are also traces of other fonts which I'm sure you can recognize (and probably nuts)

 But if that's infringing on anything, please feel free to contact me in any way (if possible, not by a cease-and-desist letter from you lawyer)

 ## The poster is distributed as different formats:

 - png (Web and "Print". There's no such thing as a png for print but you'll get less ugly pixels from the hi-res version)
 - pdf
 - InDesign

 ## What this poster will bring to your everyday work:

 - The safety of knowing that you can now easily refer to any of the Zen of Python lines by its number
 - A geek decoration to your desk surroundings that will warn people that they're about to hear some high quality philosophical pythonic advice
 - Inspiration and guid(o)ance when struggling on an important design decision
